                    As part of the final project the CS50P course, I create a
                    hangman game with Pygame using the Python programming
                    language. <br />
                    This project took me about a month to complete and I learned
                    so much about Python and game development during it. <br />
                    You can look at the GitHub repository for this project by

                    The inspiration for this project came to me after watching
                    the movie ‘The imitation game’ about the brilliant
                    mathematicians at Bletchley Park who cracked the Enigma
                    cipher and shorted WW2 and saved millions of lives! <br />
                    <br />
                    In this app you can using the Enigma cipher to cipher or
                    decipher your own secret messages. <br />
                    The instructions on who to use the app is in the README on
                    GitHub. <br />
